# LINKED-LIST-IMPLEMENTATION
*COMPANY*:CODETECH IT SOLUTIONS
*NAME*: MATURI MEGHANA
*INTREN* ID:CT06DM781
*DOMAIN* : C PROGRAMMING
*DURATION*: 6WEEK
*MENTOR*: NEELA SANTOSH
*TASK DISCRIPITION*
The objective of this project is to design and implement a Singly Linked List data structure in the C programming language. The linked list supports fundamental operations such as:
 1.Insertion (at the beginning, end, and specific position)
 2.Deletion (from the beginning, end, and specific position)
 3.Traversal (displaying all elements)
 4.Memory deallocation (freeing the entire list)
This program demonstrates dynamic memory allocation and pointer manipulation, which are essential concepts in systems programming and data structure management
*tools and technologies*
This program is written in standard C, making it portable across all major operating systems and platforms. It can be compiled and executed in:
Component        	       Description
Programming Language	  -  C (ANSI C Standard)
Compiler              -  	Turbo C++ (16-bit DOS)
Libraries	            -  stdio.h, string.h, ctype.h, conio.h
Editor                -  IDE	Turbo C++
*platform*
Turbo C++ (for educational DOS-based setups)
*Application*
This implementation of a singly linked list has both educational and practical value:
ðŸŽ“ Educational Uses
   1.Demonstrates dynamic memory management in C
   2.Teaches the fundamentals of data structures
   3.Helps understand pointer arithmetic and linked list traversal
   4.Suitable for assignments, academic projects, and practical labs
